It's quite interesting to see what movements there are in the open source
community around *Digital Mobile Radio* or DMR in short. [Jonathan Naylor G4KLX][]
has been promoting an open source GFSK/GMSK modem project called
[MMDVM][], short for *Multi-Mode Digital Voice Modem*, capable of tranceiving
DMR, D-Star and Yaesu System Fusion frames. MMDVM runs on top of an
[Arduino Due][] or a [Teensy 3.1][] development board.
A mirror of the MMDVM protocol specification is available
[here](/media/posts/radio/MMDVM Specification 20150922.pdf). If you like to get
involved in the MMDVM project, join the [MMDVM Yahoo! group]. The group targets
early testers and MMDVM developers. Mind that you have to have a **valid HAM
radio license** to play with the transmitter.

Guus van Dooren PE1PLM has been developing shields for the Arduino embedded
micro processor boards and has made an
[AMBE30000][] available for testing. This inspired me to start developing a
multi purpose, portable C library for dealing with the DMR protocol. The
AMBE3000 shield implements the G4KLX MMDVM protocol. You can track development
on our [dmrlib Github page](https://github.com/pd0mz/dmrlib).

As of today there is full receive support, as well support for talking to the
[BrandMeister][] DMR repeater master(s). However, the project is nowhere near
a public release yet.
